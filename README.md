Bucketlisters is a MERN app that allows users to create a digital bucketlist and have it stored for revision and completion. Bucketlisters focuses on the exciting joy of creating a bucket list and fulfilling the activities. The app will also allow users to return and add "completed" to their bucketlist items. A youTube video is embedded if users want to see others participating in specific activities, before choosing it as their own bucketlist item.
